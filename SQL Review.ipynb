There are many times when you will only be able to answr a question using information that exists across two different tables in your dataset. These situations are solved with the join.

    "Usually both tabled are fused along just one column on a certain condition, like being equal to each other. How they are fused along that column determines the type of join. When discussing these joins, lets assuming the condition for combining the rows is that they are equal, as if most often the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inner Join \n",
    "This type of join is where the fused tabled only has rows from its parents who had equal values in their respective columns. You can think of this as only taking the relavant rows from each table, and stitching them togehter. This is by far the most frequently used type of join, and is the type we used in our first example.\n",

    "#### Left Join (Left Outer Join)\n",
    "This type of join is where the entire first table is retrieved, then those rows who have matching values in their columns have second table rows with have matching column values added onto them. So this is like taking the whole first table and adding on only matching rows from the second table. Gives a lot of data, and it is recommended to be heavily filtered with clauses like WHERE first. \n",
